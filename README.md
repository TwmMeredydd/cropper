# Description

The Cropper mod adds a crop hopper to the game. Croppers function similarly to vanilla hoppers, however instead of extracting from inventories, they extract crops from farmland. Crops are broken and moved into the cropper's inventory. If the cropper's inventory is full, the crop is broken and items are not dropped.

Requires Fabric API.
